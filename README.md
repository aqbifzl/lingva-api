## Usage
#### Initialize client
```cpp
lingvaClient client;
//OR with default source language
lingvaClient client("auto");
//OR with default source and target language
lingvaClient client("auto", "hu");
//OR with default source and target language and custom instance
lingvaClient client("auto", "hu", "lingva.ml");
```
#### Get all available languages
```cpp
client.getLanguages();
```
> They are stored in public class member "languages" which is a vector std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>> where first element is the full name and the second is the code.
#### List all languages in human-readable format (automatically calld getLanguages() when it is empty)
```cpp
client.listLanguages();
```
#### Translate passed sentence
```cpp
client.translate("Witaj Å›wiecie!");
```
> Uses values from the initializer, or "auto" as source and "en" as target if nothing were specified in initializer
#### Translate passed sentence with custom language options
```cpp
client.translate("Hello world!", "en", "ru");
```
#### Handle error
```cpp
std::string getTranslation = client.translate(sampleSentence, "en", "error");
 if (getTranslation.length())
   std::cout << "Success";
 else
   std::cout << "Error";
```
> Simply empty result means error
